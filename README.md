# Super_store_sales_using_powerBi

## Project Objectives:
This project focuses on analyzing superstore sales data using a Power BI dashboard to generate insights.
It includes time series analysis and sales forecasting to track sales trends over time, helping stakeholders make informed decisions to improve business performance and optimize revenue growth.


## Insights:
* The most profitable months are October and December.
* March shows the highest sales, but the profit remains relatively low.
* COD is the most frequently used payment method.
* In the central region, office supplies, particularly chairs, have higher sales, while in other regions, phones are the top-selling product.
* Highest sales in the West region.

## Recomendation:
* To reduce COD deliveries, incentivize online payments through discounts or offers, improve customer trust in digital payments,
   and enhance the convenience and security of online payment options.
